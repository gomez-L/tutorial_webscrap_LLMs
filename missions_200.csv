 Plastic Recycling Project  ","
Overview of the Project
Green Cities Inc. is a youth based social enterprise operating Liberiaa¬Ä¬ôs first waste segregation and recycling center. This center was originally constructed with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2012. The goal of Green Cities is to create a clean and green environment through the implementation of a waste value chain. By collecting, processing, and selling waste the local business is creating job opportunities for young people in Liberia. To contribute to a clean environment in Monrovia, Green Cities engages in different projects. 
Green Cities started 2014 to research and pilot on how plastic could be included in the recycling process. In 2015, a plastic crusher and palletizing machine have been purchased for both film plastic such as water bags (LDPE/HDPE) and hard rubber plastic such as gallons (HDPE). Green Cities started to buy collected plastic waste from community dwellers and through this trade gives vulnerable groups of society an opportunity of income. Manually the products were cut and washed before processed further. The new raw material (pellets or crushed plastic) has been sold to local companies to produce new plastic products, instead or as addition to virgin plastic.
Since 2018 the processing was mechanized, diversified, and supplemented with the production of end-products: school materials such as rulers and rubber cups for the rubbercollection industry. The social business will have three ways of income generating: Selling of raw material (pellets or crushed hard plastic), offering services (e.g., washing dirty plastic foils and resell them without further processing), and the selling of end products.
At the same time the implementers are dedicated to professional training and further education of highly qualified recyclist. Also, the publica¬Ä¬ôs awareness must be risen of different target groups such as youth and women from densely populated communities as well as businesses like offices, hotels, restaurants. A special focus lies on school children: With school materials made from recycled plastic they can grasp literally that  waste  has value and can be transformed into something useful. All sensitization workshops focus on the processes of reduce, reuse, and recycle of the different waste materials.
Due to the state of emergency caused by the Corona-Pandemic, the planned project duration must be extended. The focus for the duration 2020 - 2022 are:

Improvement of production and sale of product
Enhancement of storage space & broad awareness / sensitization raising
Training and further education of employees and suppliers in various modules of the recyclist

The RBF¬ís grantmaking is organized around three themes: Democratic Practice, Peacebuilding, and Sustainable Development. Though the Fund pursues its three program interests in a variety of geographic contexts, including substantial work in the U.S., it has identified several specific locations on which to concentrate cross-programmatic attention. The Fund refers to these as 'pivotal places': subnational areas, nation-states, or cross-border regions that have special importance with regard to the Fund¬ís substantive concerns and whose future will have disproportionate significance for the future of a surrounding region, an ecosystem, or the world. The Fund currently works in two pivotal places: China and the Western Balkans. The Charles E. Culpeper Arts & Culture program, focused on New York, nurtures a vibrant and inclusive arts community in the Fund¬ís home city. These six programs reflect board and staff assessment of the challenges facing today¬ís increasingly interdependent world on which strategic philanthropy and the Fund¬ís accumulated grantmaking experience can have a meaningful impact.
Through its grantmaking, the Fund supports efforts to expand knowledge, clarify values and critical choices, nurture creative expression, and shape public policy. The Fund¬ís programs are intended to develop leaders, strengthen institutions, engage citizens, build community, and foster partnerships that include government, business, and civil society. Respect for cultural diversity and ecological integrity pervades the Fund¬ís activities.
The Rockefeller Brothers Fund also manages The Pocantico Center as part of an agreement with the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The Pocantico Center is a venue for conferences and meetings on critical issues related to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund¬ís mission.
